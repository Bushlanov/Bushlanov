<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>Financial markets are inherently probabilistic. Directly forecasting trends or specific pricing levels makes little sense compared to building a probabilistic view of the future, from which concrete trading decisions can be made. The TPO (time-price opportunity) profile is a great example of this kind of forecast—and an interesting tool to work with. It makes you ask questions and see things you didn’t before.</p>
